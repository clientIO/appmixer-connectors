The API is restricted to users on a Business or Enterprise plan. The API allows you to do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read or update sheets</li>\n<li>Manage folders and workspaces</li>\n<li>Administer user accounts and organization account</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you scroll to the Developer Reference section, you can view code examples in the programming language of your choice by clicking the corresponding tab in the rightmost pane. Each tab corresponds to a Software Development Kit (SDK) that Smartsheet provides to make working in that programming language easier. See <a href=\"#section/API-Basics/SDKs-and-Sample-Code\">SDKs and Sample Code</a>.</p>\n<p>NOTES:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the introduction, the rightmost pane is blank. Code samples are visible there at the endpoint level.</li>\n<li>If you have feedback on the documentation, you can reach us using the <a href=\"https://community.smartsheet.com/categories/api-developers\">Smartsheet Community API Category</a>.</li>\n<li>Your use of the Smartsheet APIs and SDKs are governed by the <a href=\"https://www.smartsheet.com/legal/developer-program-agreement\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Developer Agreement</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"apibasics\">API Basics</h1>\n<h2 id=\"assumeuser\">Assume User</h2>\n<p>Allows an admin to act on behalf of, or impersonate, the user to make API calls. You might do this to troubleshoot a user problem or cover for vacations and sick time. As with cURL, the email address used to identify the user must be URI-encoded.</p>\n<p>An admin cannot impersonate another admin.</p>\n<p>NOTE: You must manually generate a token to assume user.</p>\n<h2 id=\"authenticationandaccesstokens\">Authentication and Access Tokens</h2>\n<p>The Smartsheet API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization. An HTTP header containing an access token is required to authenticate each request.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To familiarize yourself with the API, you can generate a raw token. See <a href=\"#section/API-Basics/Raw-Token-Requests\">Raw Token Requests</a>.</li>\n<li>For additional security and as a recommended best practice, you should build an integration using OAuth 2.0. During the <a href=\"#section/Security/Adding-Security-by-Using-OAuth\">OAuth process</a>, you will generate several API keys and, ultimately, each user will generate a unique access token.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WARNING: If an unauthorized user gets a copy of this token, they will be able to access all Smartsheet data that you have access to, both to read and modify on your behalf. You should keep your tokens secure and do not share them with anyone. See <a href=\"#section/Security\">Security</a> for best practices.</p>\n<h2 id=\"datesandtimes\">Dates and Times</h2>\n<p>The Smartsheet API returns all dates and times in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UTC</a> time zone in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ISO-8601</a> format, that is, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.  If you are specifying a date and time, you should also send that information in ISO-8601 format. If a date/time needs to be displayed to an end-user in their local time zone, you must do the conversion using the user's time zone, which you can obtain by <a href=\"/tag/users#operation/get-current-user\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">getting the current user</a>.</p>\n<p>You can optionally choose to receive and send dates/times in numeric format, as milliseconds since the UNIX epoch (midnight on January 1, 1970 in UTC time), using the query string parameter <strong>numericDates</strong> with a value of <strong>true</strong>. This query parameter works for any API request.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Some SDK methods use language-specific Date objects, which require different date formats.</p>\n<h2 id=\"filtering\">Filtering</h2>\n<p>You cannot create or update filters using the API; however, you can query which rows have been filtered out and you can get filter definitions.</p>\n<p>For details, see <a href=\"/tag/sheetsObjects#section/Filters-Object\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Filters object</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"formatting\">Formatting</h2>\n<p>To set or read formatting programmatically, Smartsheet uses a compact format string, <strong>cell.format</strong>, which looks something like this: <code>\",,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"</code>. The position and sample values in this string are explained in the following format descriptor table:</p>\n<p><strong>Format Descriptor Table</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Position</strong> | <strong>Lookup Property</strong> | <strong>Example Value</strong> | <strong>Format String</strong>\n-----|-----|-----|-----|\n0 | <strong>fontFamily</strong> | 0 = Arial, default | <code>\"0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"</code>\n1 | <strong>fontSize</strong> | 0 = 10 pt, default | <code>\",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"</code>\n2 | <strong>bold</strong> | 1 = on | <code>\",,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"</code>\n3 | <strong>italic</strong> | 1 = on | <code>\",,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"</code>\n4 | <strong>underline</strong> | 1 = on | <code>\",,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,\"</code>\n5 | <strong>strikethrough</strong> | 1 = on | <code>\",,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,\"</code>\n6 | <strong>horizontalAlign</strong> | 2 = center | <code>\",,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,\"</code>\n7 | <strong>verticalAlign</strong> | 2 = middle | <code>\",,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,\"</code>\n8 | <strong>color</strong> (text) | 4 = #FEEEF0 | <code>\",,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,\"</code>\n9 | <strong>color</strong> (background) | 8 = #E6F5FE | <code>\",,,,,,,,,8,,,,,,,\"</code>\n10 | <strong>color</strong> (taskbar) | 9 = #F3E5FA | <code>\",,,,,,,,,,9,,,,,,\"</code>\n11 | <strong>currency</strong> | 13 = USD | <code>\",,,,,,,,,,,13,,,,,\"</code>\n12 | <strong>decimalCount</strong> | 3 = three decimal places | <code>\",,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,\"</code>\n13 | <strong>thousandsSeparator</strong> | 1 = on | <code>\",,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,\"</code>\n14 | <strong>numberFormat</strong> | 2 = currency | <code>\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,\"</code>\n15 | <strong>textWrap</strong> | 1 = on | <code>\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,\"</code>\n16 | <strong>dateFormat</strong> | 1 = mmmm d yyyy (December 8, 1997) | <code>\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1\"</code></p>\n<p>NOTES:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Formats that have not been explicitly set are omitted in the descriptor string. For example, a cell that has been set to bold and italic, but has no other formats applied to it, has a format descriptor of <code>\",,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"</code>.</li>\n<li>Use <code>GET /serverinfo</code> to return the <a href=\"/tag/commonObjects#section/FormatTables-Object\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FormatTables</a> object, which tells you both the default settings and what formatting options are available.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Applying Formatting</strong></p>\n<p>Use the \"include=format\" query-string parameter on API operations that return detailed objects, such as <code>GET /sheets/{sheetId}</code> or <code>GET sheets/{sheetId}/rows/{rowId}</code>. If there is formatting other than default settings, the return includes a <strong>format</strong> property. If an object has conditional formatting, the <strong>format</strong> property returned will have a <strong>conditionalFormat</strong> value.</p>\n<p>Setting the format of a row object or column object through the API simply sets the baseline format for new or blank cells in that row or column.  It does not affect cells that already have a value.</p>\n<p>If you want to change the formatting of cells that already have content, for instance you want to make a row bold, then you have to set the format for each cell individually.</p>\n<h2 id=\"formulas\">Formulas</h2>\n<p>Formulas are processed per cell in the UI. Use the <a href=\"/tag/cellsObjects#section/Cell-Object\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cell object</a> to manipulate formulas via the API.</p>\n<p>For requests, use <a href=\"/tag/rows#operation/update-rows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Update Rows</a> to add or update the formula in a cell.</p>\n<p>For response payloads, formulas (when present) are returned whenever the Cell object is returned, so for example, GET /sheets/(id) returns the Cell object for each cell and that object contains a <strong>formula</strong> value when the cell contains a formula.</p>\n<h2 id=\"httpandrest\">HTTP and REST</h2>\n<p>The REST URL structure follows typical resource-oriented conventions.</p>\n<p>To get a list of sheets, use the following:</p>\n<p><code>GET https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets</code></p>\n<p>This returns a list of Sheet objects, where each sheet has an <strong>id</strong> attribute.</p>\n<p>To get details on the sheet with <strong>id 123456</strong>, use the following:</p>\n<p><code>GET https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/123456</code></p>\n<p>This Id pattern is repeated throughout the API. Columns, rows, cells, comments, attachments, or any other data element have a unique Id.</p>\n<p>If you don't want to make raw HTTP calls, Smartsheet also has several Software Development Kits (SDKs) that provide a higher level interface for popular programming languages. For more information, see <a href=\"#section/API-Basics/SDKs-and-Sample-Code\">SDKs and Sample Code</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"httpheaders\">HTTP Headers</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise specified, all API endpoints expect request body data to be in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">JSON</a>, and the response body data is returned as JSON.</p>\n<p>The following HTTP request headers may be required, depending on the operation and endpoint being invoked:</p>\n<p>Header | Definition | Example |\n-----|-----|-----|\n<strong>Authorization</strong> | Required for all endpoints, except for <code>POST /token</code>. The access token. | Bearer JKlMNOpQ12RStUVwxYZAbcde3F5g6hijklM789\n<strong>Content-Type</strong> | Required for POST and PUT requests. Defines the structure for the response. | application/json\n<strong>Assume-User</strong> | Optional. Allows an admin to act on behalf of, or impersonate, the user to make API calls. The email address used to identify the user must be URI-encoded. | jane.doe%40smartsheet.com</p>\n<h2 id=\"httpverbs\">HTTP Verbs</h2>\n<p>Call the API using the following <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">standard HTTP methods</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GET (to retrieve an object or list multiple objects in a specific category)</li>\n<li>POST (to create)</li>\n<li>PUT (to modify)</li>\n<li>DELETE</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"httpstatuscodes\">HTTP Status Codes</h2>\n<p>Smartsheet uses a combination of <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HTTP status codes</a> and custom error codes with a descriptive message in JSON-formatted <a href=\"/tag/commonObjects#section/Error-Object\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Error objects</a> to give you a more complete picture of what has happened with your request.</p>\n<p>HTTP<br/>status code | Meaning | To Retry or Not to Retry? |\n-----|-----|-----|\n2xx | Request was successful.<br/><br/>Example: 200 Success | --\n4xx | A problem with request prevented it from executing successfully. | Never automatically retry the request.<br/><br/>If the error code indicates a problem that can be fixed, fix the problem and retry the request.\n5xx | The request was properly formatted, but the operation failed on Smartsheet's end. | In some scenarios, requests should be automatically retried using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">exponential backoff</a>.</p>\n<p>For example, doing a <code>GET</code> on a non-existent sheet at <code>https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/123456</code> results in an HTTP status code of <strong>404</strong>, indicating the resource was not found.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"json language-json\">{\n  \"errorCode\": 1006,\n  \"message\": \"Not Found\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Some errors may contain a <strong>detail</strong> attribute set to an object with additional error details that may be useful in programmatically handling the error.  If so, it is noted in the specific API operation for which the error may occur.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Smartsheet has custom error codes to help you troubleshoot issues. See the complete <a href=\"#section/Error-Code-List\">Error Code List</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"multicontactormultipicklistworkingwithcomplexobjects\">Multi-contact or Multi-picklist: Working with Complex Objects</h2>\n<p>New column types, such as MULTI<em>CONTACT</em>LIST and MULTI_PICKLIST, offer more complex ways to work with columns. Smartsheet has provided a backwards compatible way for these payloads to work with your existing integrations while also giving you a way to query for their content.</p>\n<p>With either column type, there are two ways of receiving the response:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you do nothing to your code, column types will display as TEXT_NUMBER</li>\n<li>If you use the level query parameter as detailed below, column types will display as MULTI<em>CONTACT</em>LIST or MULTI_PICKLIST and return a complex object (aka a non-primitive type)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Smartsheet uses two indicators to help you discover changes in the return data for your API calls:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>level: a query parameter that is incremented when a new feature or column type is added</li>\n<li>version: each element in the Columns array is set to one of the following values:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Text | Multi-contact | Multi-picklist\n-----|-----|-----|\n0 | 1 | 2</p>\n<p>You must use the level query parameter, for example <strong>level=2</strong>, to return a complex object with the new column type. Without the query parameter, the response will be backwards-compatible, that is a string.</p>\n<p>Use the highest possible level for each endpoint, as in the following table:</p>\n<p>Endpoint category | Level\n-----|-----|\nDashboards | 4\nReports | 3\nSheets | 2</p>\n<p>NOTE: The <b>include=objectValue</b> query parameter is necessary to see the return as a complex value, such as actual email addresses rather than display names.</p>\n<h2 id=\"objectdetailsvslistsummaries\">Object Details vs List Summaries</h2>\n<p>Many of the List All commands, for example, <code>GET /sheets</code>, return only an abbreviated object for each object returned. For full details, read a single item, such as <code>GET /sheets/{sheetId}</code>. In many cases, you can refine the exact object properties to be returned by using <strong>include</strong> and <strong>exclude</strong> query parameters.</p>\n<p>The JSON representation of the objects returned from the List All REST endpoints will only include a subset of the properties documented here. However, the objects returned from the Java and C# SDKs will represent the omitted properties with NULLs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"querystrings\">Query Strings</h2>\n<p>Many API calls can be modified by including one or more of these common query strings:</p>\n<p>Query Parameter | Type | Description | More Info |\n-----|-----|-----|-----|\n<strong>accessApiLevel</strong> | Number | Allows COMMENTER access for inputs and return values. For backwards-compatibility, VIEWER is the default. For example, to see whether a user has COMMENTER access for a sheet, use accessApiLevel=1. |\n<strong>allowPartialSuccess</strong> | Boolean | If <strong>true</strong>, allows bulk operations to process even if one or more operations are invalid for some reason, for example, <strong>allowPartialSuccess=true</strong>. | <a href=\"#section/Work-at-Scale/Bulk-Operations\">Bulk Operations</a>\n<strong>include</strong> or <strong>exclude</strong> | String | When applicable for a specific object, various <strong>include</strong> or <strong>exclude</strong> parameters are available, for example, <strong>include=format</strong>. | Object reference or <a href=\"#section/API-Basics/Formatting\">Formatting</a>\n<strong>includeAll</strong> | Boolean | If <strong>true</strong>, includes all results, for example, <strong>includeAll=true</strong>. | <a href=\"#section/Work-at-Scale/Paging\">Paging</a>\n<strong>numericDates</strong> | Boolean | If <strong>true</strong>, allows you to input or receive dates in numeric format, for example, <strong>numericDates=true</strong>. | <a href=\"#section/API-Basics/Dates-and-Times\">Dates and Times</a>\n<strong>page</strong> | String | Specifies which page to return, for example, <strong>page=4</strong>. | <a href=\"#section/Work-at-Scale/Paging\">Paging</a>\n<strong>pageSize</strong> | Number | Specifies the maximum number of items to return per page, for example, <strong>pageSize=25</strong>. | <a href=\"#section/Work-at-Scale/Paging\">Paging</a></p>\n<p>NOTE: Query strings are case sensitive. If you do not see the expected response, confirm that your query is formatted correctly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rawtokenrequests\">Raw Token Requests</h2>\n<p>If you want to get started quickly, or are developing a standalone application that can run with your credentials, follow these instructions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click the \"Account\" button in the lower-left corner of the Smartsheet screen, and then click \"Personal Settings\".</li>\n<li>Click the \"API Access\" tab.</li>\n<li>Click the \"Generate new access token\" button to obtain an access token.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The access token must be sent with every API call in an HTTP authorization header (except for the requests to Get Access Token or Refresh Access Token). Once you have an access token, include it in the <strong>Authorization</strong> header for every request you make:</p>\n<p><code>Authorization: Bearer JKlMNOpQ12RStUVwxYZAbcde3F5g6hijklM789</code></p>\n<p>The header name is <strong>Authorization</strong> and the value of the header is <strong>Bearer JKlMNOpQ12RStUVwxYZAbcde3F5g6hijklM789</strong>. Since the access token is being transmitted in clear text, all API calls are done over HTTPS.</p>\n<p>NOTE: A best practice is to use a shared account, such as ticket-processor@example.com, rather than your individual work account.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sdksandsamplecode\">SDKs and Sample Code</h2>\n<p>Smartsheet has Software Development Kits (SDKs) providing a higher level interface for several languages.</p>\n<p>Language | SDK | Sample application\n-----|-----|-----|\nC# | <a href=\"https://github.com/smartsheet/smartsheet-csharp-sdk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">smartsheet-csharp-sdk</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/smartsheet-samples/csharp-read-write-sheet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">csharp-read-write-sheet</a>\nJava | <a href=\"https://github.com/smartsheet/smartsheet-java-sdk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">smartsheet-java-sdk</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/smartsheet-samples/java-read-write-sheet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">java-read-write-sheet</a>\nNode.js | <a href=\"https://github.com/smartsheet/smartsheet-javascript-sdk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">smartsheet-javascript-sdk</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/smartsheet-samples/node-read-write-sheet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">node-read-write-sheet</a>\nPython | <a href=\"https://github.com/smartsheet/smartsheet-python-sdk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">smartsheet-python-sdk</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/smartsheet-samples/python-read-write-sheet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">python-read-write-sheet</a>\nRuby* | <a href=\"https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-ruby-sdk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">smartsheet-ruby-sdk</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/smartsheet-samples/ruby-read-write-sheet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ruby-read-write-sheet</a></p>\n<p>In addition to the sample application provided for each SDK, you can always view code examples in this document by clicking the corresponding tab in the dark-blue area in the rightmost pane.</p>\n<p>To use an SDK for development work, follow the instructions in the SDK readme to download and install the SDK. Then download the sample app and run it. Once you've run the sample application, you can clone it and use the structure it provides to start building your own applications.</p>\n<p>*The Ruby SDK is no longer maintained. It is still usable, but new functionality may be missing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sheetscolumnsrowscells\">Sheets/Columns/Rows/Cells</h2>\n<p>Sheets are composed of rows, columns, and cells. A cell is identified by the Id of its row and column. The following table defines these terms and points you to places in this documentation where you can find more information:</p>\n<p>UI Element | Description | More Info\n-----|-----|-----|\nsheet | A sheet can exist in a user's <a href=\"../../tag/homeDescription\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Home</a> folder, in a <a href=\"../../tag/foldersDescription\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">folder</a>, or in a <a href=\"../../tag/workspacesDescription/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">workspace</a>. It is comprised of columns, rows, and cells, and may optionally contain attachments or discussions. | <a href=\"/tag/sheetsObjects#section/Sheet-Object\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sheet object</a>\ncolumn | A Column object <em>defines</em> the type of the column, but does not actually contain cells. The Column Id identifies the cells in a row. | <a href=\"../../tag/columnsObjects#section/Column-Object\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Column object</a>, <a href=\"../../tag/columnsRelated#section/Column-Types\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Column types</a>\nrow | A row is a component of a sheet or report. Each row is composed of a collection of cells, and may optionally contain attachments or discussions. | <a href=\"/tag/rowsObjects#section/Row-Object\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Row object</a>\ncell | A cell is a location within a sheet that may contain a value. A collection of cells comprises each row in a sheet. | <a href=\"/tag/cellsObjects#section/Cell-Object\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cell object</a>, <a href=\"/tag/cellsRelated#section/Cell-Reference\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cell reference</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"versioningandchanges\">Versioning and Changes</h2>\n<p>Smartsheet will add new functionality and bug fixes to the API over time. Make sure that your code can handle new JSON properties gracefully. Also, make sure your code does not depend on the order in which JSON objects are returned, unless it is explicitly stated in this documentation.</p>\n<p>When there is new functionality that is not compatible with existing code, say in the case of a new concept, Smartsheet increments the level to indicate the new feature can be ignored until you are ready to implement the code to work with the new level.</p>\n<p>See also: <a href=\"#section/API-Basics/Multi-contact-or-Multi-picklist:-Working-with-Complex-Objects\">Multi-contact or Multi-picklist: Working with Complex Objects</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"codewalkthrough\">Code Walkthrough</h1>\n<h2 id=\"makeyourfirstapicall\">Make Your First API Call</h2>\n<p>Before you write any code, try executing API requests using a tool like <a href=\"https://curl.haxx.se/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cURL</a> or <a href=\"https://www.postman.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Postman</a>. By taking your code out of the equation, you can isolate troubleshooting to the raw request and response.</p>\n<p>You must use an access token. See instructions at <a href=\"#section/API-Basics/Authentication-and-Access-Tokens\">Authentication and Access Tokens</a>. In the examples below, replace this sample token, \"JKlMNOpQ12RStUVwxYZAbcde3F5g6hijklM789\", with your actual token value.</p>\n<p>WARNING: If an unauthorized user gets a copy of this token, they will be able to access all Smartsheet data that you have access to, both to read and modify on your behalf. You should keep your tokens secure and do not share them with anyone. See <a href=\"#section/Security\">Security</a> for best practices.</p>\n<p>To get a list of all your sheets, try the following command:</p>\n<p><code>curl -X GET -H \"Authorization: Bearer JKlMNOpQ12RStUVwxYZAbcde3F5g6hijklM789\" \"https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets\"</code></p>\n<p>In Postman, the request looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/postman-sampleb.png\" alt=\"Postman screen shot\"></p>\n<p>The JSON result should look something like this (after formatting):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"json language-json\">{\n  \"pageNumber\": 1,\n  \"pageSize\": 100,\n  \"totalPages\": 1,\n  \"totalCount\": 2,\n  \"data\": [{\n             \"id\": 6141831453927300,\n             \"name\": \"My first sheet\",\n             \"accessLevel\": \"ADMIN\",\n             \"permalink\": \"https://app.smartsheet.com/b/home?lx=8enlO7GkdYSz-cHHVus33A\",\n             \"createdAt\": \"2016-01-28T22:02:35Z\",\n             \"modifiedAt\": \"2016-08-09T17:50:06Z\"\n           },\n           {\n             \"id\": 6141831453927300,\n             \"name\": \"Sheet shared to me\",\n             \"accessLevel\": \"VIEWER\",\n             \"permalink\": \"https://app.smartsheet.com/b/home?lx=8enlO7GkdYSz-cHHVus33A\",\n             \"createdAt\": \"2016-01-28T22:02:35Z\",\n             \"modifiedAt\": \"2016-08-09T17:50:06Z\"\n           }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"howtoreadasheetresponse\">How to Read a Sheet Response</h2>\n<p>Many Smartsheet API operations handle sheets, rows, columns, and cells. Each is identified by an Id and it is important to understand the relationship between these objects. Typically you loop through the columns to determine the Id of the columns you are interested in. Then you loop through the rows and contained cells to find actual values.

If you are building an app, this documentation will walk you through the steps you need to authenticate your users. The Smartsheet <a href=\"#section/API-Basics/SDKs-and-Sample-Code\">SDKs</a> contain APIs for OAuth 2.0.</p>\n<p><em>NOTE:</em> For users of apps like AWS's AppFabric, you will need a Tenant ID. You can find your Tenant ID in Admin Center under <em>Security & Controls</em>. There is a <em>Smartsheet Tenant ID</em> pane.</p>\n<h2 id=\"firststeps\">First Steps</h2>\n<p>Before you can start using OAuth 2.0 with your app, Smartsheet needs the following information:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You must <a href=\"https://developers.smartsheet.com/register\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">register</a> with Smartsheet to get a developer account*. The developer account gives you access to \"Developer Tools\", which is where you manage your app.</li>\n<li>In \"Developer Tools\", complete any required fields in your developer profile.</li>\n<li>In \"Developer Tools\", register your app so Smartsheet can assign a client Id and a client secret to the app.</li>\n<li>Review the list of access scopes. You'll need to choose which ones your app needs to get to a user's Smartsheet data, and then ask the user to consent to that access.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After you've worked through these steps, you'll be ready to implement the <a href=\"#section/OAuth-Walkthrough/OAuth-Flow\">OAuth Flow</a>.</p>\n<p><em>NOTE:</em> Your use of the Smartsheet APIs and SDKs are governed by the <a href=\"https://www.smartsheet.com/legal/developer-program-agreement\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Developer Agreement</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"opendevelopertools\">Open Developer Tools</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Smartsheet with your developer account.</li>\n<li>Click the \"Account\" button in the lower-left corner of your Smartsheet screen, and then click \"Developer Tools\".</li>\n<li>Do one of the following:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>If you need to register an app, click \"Create New App\".</li>\n<li>If you need to manage an app, click \"view/edit\" for the app.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"registeryourappusingdevelopertools\">Register Your App Using Developer Tools</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Smartsheet with your developer account.</li>\n<li>Click the \"Account\" button in the upper-right corner of your Smartsheet screen, and then click \"Developer Tools\".</li>\n<li>In the \"Create New App\" form, provide the following information:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Name: the name the user sees to identify your app</li>\n<li>Description: a brief description intended for the user</li>\n<li>URL: the URL to launch your app, or the landing page if not a web app</li>\n<li>Contact/support: support information for the user</li>\n<li>Redirect URL: also known as a callback URL. The URL within your application\nthat will receive the OAuth 2.0 credentials\nAfter you click \"Save\", Smartsheet assigns a client Id and secret to your app. Make a note of these Ids for the next steps; however, you can always look them up again in \"Developer Tools\".</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"oauthflow\">OAuth Flow</h2>\n<p>Your app must implement a 3-legged OAuth flow to retrieve an access token it can use to access Smartsheet data on behalf of an end user.\nThe following diagram has an overview of the OAuth flow:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/OAuth_flow2.png\" alt=\"Simplified graphic showing what data is passed back and forth during OAuth flow\"></p>\n<p>NOTE: App registration and OAuth flow require HTTPS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"accessscopes\">Access Scopes</h2>\n<p>To access a user's Smartsheet data, your application must explicitly ask the user for permission. You do this by using access scopes, which enable your app to communicate to the user what type of operations it is performing.\nAccess scopes do not override existing <a href=\"#section/Security/Access-Levels\">access-level restrictions</a>.\nFor example, having the access scope of <strong>WRITE_SHEETS</strong> does not allow your app to update a sheet on which the user has <strong>VIEWER</strong> access level.</p>\n<p>The access scopes are as follows:</p>\n<p>Access Scope | Description\n-----|-----|\nADMIN<em>SHEETS | Modify sheet structure, including column definition, publish state, etc.\nADMIN</em>SIGHTS | Modify Sights/dashboards structure.\nADMIN<em>USERS | Add and remove users from your Smartsheet organization account; create groups and manage membership.\nADMIN</em>WEBHOOKS | Create, delete, and update webhooks; get all webhooks; reset shared secret.\nADMIN<em>WORKSPACES | Create and manage workspaces and folders, including sharing.\nCREATE</em>SHEETS | Create new sheets.\nCREATE<em>SIGHTS | Create new Sights/dashboards.\nDELETE</em>SHEETS | Delete sheets.\nDELETE<em>SIGHTS | Delete Sights/dashboards.\nREAD</em>CONTACTS | Retrieve contacts.\nREAD<em>EVENTS | Retrieve events.\nREAD</em>SHEETS | Read all sheet data, including attachments, discussions, and cell data.\nREAD<em>SIGHTS | Read all Sights/dashboards data.\nREAD</em>USERS | Retrieve users and groups for your Smartsheet organization account.\nSHARE<em>SHEETS | Share sheets, including sending sheets as attachments.\nSHARE</em>SIGHTS | Share Sights/dashboards.\nWRITE_SHEETS | Insert and modify sheet data, including attachments, discussions, and cell data.</p>\n<p>NOTE: <b>Additional Info:</b><ul><li>When you request an authorization code, you specify all of the access scopes you need for your app. Smartsheet encodes those permissions into the auth code and subsequent access token.</li><li>Your app must request at least one access scope, but should only request the scopes necessary.</li><li>Once your app attains a valid access token, it can execute a <a href=\"/tag/users#operation/get-current-user\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Get Current User</a> operation, regardless of which access scopes were requested.</li></ul></p>\n<h2 id=\"requestanauthorizationcode\">Request an Authorization Code</h2>\n<p><code>GET https://app.smartsheet.com/b/authorize</code></p>\n<p><code>POST https://app.smartsheet.com/b/authorize</code></p>\n<p>Initiates the process to get authorization from the user.\nSmartsheet will redirect this URL to display your app's consent page with an explanation of the data the app will need access to. This consent page is autogenerated by Smartsheet based on a combination of the information you registered for your app and the parameters you send with the request.</p>\n<p>Value | Description |\n-----|-----|\n<strong>client<em>id</strong> | Required.

An arbitrary string of your choosing that is returned to your app; a successful roundtrip of this string helps ensure that your app initiated the request.</p>\n<p>You can view code examples by clicking the corresponding tab in the rightmost pane. The cURL example shows a <code>GET</code>.</p>\n<p>A correctly formatted Auth URL request looks like this: <code>https://app.smartsheet.com/b/authorize?response_type=code&amp;client_id=dheu3dmkd32fhxme&amp;scope=READ_SHEETS%20WRITE_SHEETS&amp;state=MY_STATE</code></p>\n<p>NOTE: If the user has not yet logged into Smartsheet, the redirect will first take them to a login page, and then display the consent page.</p>\n<p>At this point, the user can authorize your app to access their Smartsheet account, as in the following example:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/developer_tools3.png\" alt=\"Dialog box to allow or deny scopes\"></p>\n<p>After the user clicks \"Allow\" or \"Deny\", you'll receive a response from Smartsheet outlined in the next sections.</p>\n<h2 id=\"iftheuserclicksallow\">If the User Clicks Allow</h2>\n<p>If the user clicks \"Allow\", Smartsheet redirects the user to the callback URL with the following parameters:</p>\n<p>Value | Description |\n-----|-----|\n<strong>code</strong> | Authorization code required to obtain access token, such as 'sample6p9qisx6a'.\n<strong>expires_in</strong> | Number of milliseconds code is valid once issued; this is currently 599135 milliseconds, or approx. 10 minutes--you must obtain an access token within that time.\n<strong>state</strong> | The same value for <strong>state</strong> that you sent when you requested the authorization code.</p>\n<p>At this point, you should verify the <strong>state</strong> value matches what you sent to the user when you requested the authorization code. This helps you determine that the response came from the user and not a malicious script. If the values do not match, you should reject the response.</p>\n<p>For other error conditions, see the list of <a href=\"#section/OAuth-Walkthrough/OAuth-Error-Types\">OAuth Error Types</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"iftheuserclicksdeny\">If the User Clicks Deny</h2>\n<p>If the user clicks \"Deny\", Smartsheet redirects the user to the callback URL with the following parameters:</p>\n<p>Value | Description |\n-----|-----|\n<strong>error</strong> | \"access_denied\".\n<strong>state</strong> | The same value for <strong>state</strong> that you sent when you requested the authorization code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getorrefreshanaccesstoken\">Get or Refresh an Access Token</h2>\n<p>Once you’ve successfully obtained an authorization code, the next step is to exchange the code for an access token.

By taking your code out of the equation, you can isolate troubleshooting to the raw Request / Response.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you receive a similar error when you execute the Request using cURL or Postman, this suggests an issue with the Request format or contents. Once you have the Request working in cURL or Postman, update your code accordingly.</li>\n<li>If you can execute the Request successfully using cURL or Postman, but not via your code, this suggests that the Request your code is sending is somehow different than what you intend. Compare the (successful) Request from cURL or Postman with the (unsuccessful) Request that your code generates. (See step #2 below.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Examine the Request that your code is sending (including the HTTP verb, URI, headers, and Request body) and the Response that it's receiving back from Smartsheet (including the HTTP status code, headers, and response body).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you've implemented Request / Response logging in your application, inspect the full trace of Request and Response in the log file. Compare the Request that your application is logging with the (successful) Request from cURL or Postman, and update your code to correct any discrepancies.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, you may choose to use a tool like <a href=\"https://www.telerik.com/fiddler\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fiddler</a> or <a href=\"https://www.charlesproxy.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Charles HTTP Proxy</a> to inspect the full trace of Request and Response as it goes across the wire. Compare the Request trace that your application generates with the (successful) Request from cURL or Postman, and update your code to correct any discrepancies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check for capitalization errors. <strong>NOTE:</strong> URL endpoints are all lower case, while object properties and query parameters are camelCase.</p>\n<h1 id=\"workatscale\">Work at Scale</h1>\n<h2 id=\"bulkoperations\">Bulk Operations</h2>\n<p>The Smartsheet API supports a number of bulk operations that can operate on multiple objects.  Unlike single-object operations, bulk operations allow you to create, update, or delete\nmultiple objects in a single request. For example, if you want to update 10 rows within a sheet, do so using a single <a href=\"/tag/rows#operation/update-rows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Update Rows</a> request, rather than executing 10 separate requests - one for each row.</p>\n<p><strong>Optional Bulk Operations</strong></p>\n<p>Several endpoints support optional bulk <code>POST</code> operations which exist alongside the standard single-object <code>POST</code>.  For these endpoints, you may pass in either a single object or an array of objects.\nDepending on what was passed in, the <a href=\"/tag/commonObjects/#section/Result-Object\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Result object</a> returned contains either a single object or an array.  An example optional bulk operation is <a href=\"/tag/favorites#operation/add-favorite\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">POST /favorites</a>: you can\npass in a single <a href=\"/tag/favoritesObjects#section/Favorite-Object\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Favorite object</a> to create a single favorite, or an array of Favorite objects to create multiple favorites in a single request.  Endpoints which support bulk operations are\nnoted as such in the API reference documentation.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Most <code>POST</code> operations fail when attempting to create a single object which already exists (for example, favorites, shares, group members).  However, for the corresponding bulk operations, these endpoints do <em>not</em>\nreturn an error if one or more items in the array already exist.  Existing items are simply ignored, and the <a href=\"/tag/commonObjects#section/Result-Object\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Result object</a> returned omits them.</p>\n<p><strong>Partial Success</strong></p>\n<p>In general, the default behavior for bulk operations is to fail outright if any of the objects in the request are invalid for some reason.  If successful, Smartsheet creates/updates/deletes all objects in the request;\nif not, no objects are changed.</p>\n<p>However, there are some operations that support partial success, which means the operation still succeeds even if one or more of the objects in the request fails for some reason (for example, an object is invalid). Here is another example: if you want to update more than one row, you send more than one row object in your request. If a row object is invalid, that row update will fail, but the other row updates will succeed.  Partial success is\n<em>not</em> the default mode for an operation and you must explicitly enable it by using a query string parameter.  This is noted in the documentation for operations that support partial success.</p>\n<p>When partial success is enabled, and one or more of the objects in the request fail to be added/updated/deleted, a standard <a href=\"../../tag/commonObjects#section/Result-Object\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Result object</a> is returned, but with a <strong>message</strong> of <b>'PARTIAL_SUCCESS'</b> (instead of <b>'SUCCESS'</b>), and a <strong>resultCode</strong> of <strong>3</strong>. Additionally, the object contains a <strong>failedItems</strong> attribute -- an array of <a href=\"/tag/commonObjects#section/BulkItemFailure-Object\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BulkItemFailure objects</a> that contains an item for each object in the request that failed to be added/updated/deleted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"paging\">Paging</h2>\n<p>The Smartsheet API contains a number of index endpoints (typically denoted in the documentation with titles beginning with \"Get All\" or \"List\") which return arrays of objects.\nExamples include <code>GET</code> <a href=\"/tag/users#operation/list-users\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">/users</a>, <a href=\"/tag/sheets#operation/list-sheets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">/sheets</a>, <a href=\"/tag/columns#operation/columns-listOnSheet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">/sheets/{sheetId}/columns</a>, and many others.  These endpoints all support pagination, meaning\nyou can retrieve paged subsets of results, enabling you to process potentially large result sets in smaller chunks.</p>\n<p><strong>Paging Query String Parameters</strong></p>\n<p>Index endpoints all support pagination via the following optional query string parameters:</p>\n<p>Value | Type | Description |\n------|------|-------------|\n<strong>includeAll</strong>  | Boolean | If true, include all results, that is, do not paginate.  Mutually exclusive with <strong>page</strong> and <strong>pageSize</strong> (they are ignored if <strong>includeAll=true</strong> is specified).\n<strong>page</strong>        | number  | Which page to return.  Defaults to <strong>1</strong> if not specified.  If you specify a value greater than the total number of pages, the last page of results is returned.\n<strong>pageSize</strong>     | number  | The maximum number of items to return per page.  Unless otherwise stated for a specific endpoint, defaults to <strong>100</strong>.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Most index endpoints default to a page size of 100 results.  If you want all results at once, you must specify the <b>includeAll=true</b> query string parameter.</p>\n<p><strong>Paged Responses</strong></p>\n<p>Index endpoints all return paged responses via an IndexResult object, which provides paging metadata that can be used to navigate the full set of pages in the result set:</p>\n<p>Value | Type | Description |\n------|------|-------------|\n<strong>data</strong>        | array  | An array of objects representing the current page of data in the result set.\n<strong>pageNumber</strong>    | number | The current page in the full result set that the <strong>data</strong> array represents. NOTE: when a page number greater than <strong>totalPages</strong> is requested, the last page is instead returned.\n<strong>pageSize</strong>    | number | The number of items in a page.  Omitted if there is no limit to page size (and hence, all results are included).  Unless otherwise specified, this defaults to <strong>100</strong> for most endpoints.\n<strong>totalCount</strong>    | number | The total number of items in the full result set.\n<strong>totalPages</strong>    | number | The total number of pages in the full result set.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ratelimiting\">Rate Limiting</h2>\n<p><strong>Handle \"Rate limit exceeded\" Error</strong></p>\n<p>To prevent abuse and undue stress on the Smartsheet servers, the API has a rate limiting feature (sometimes called throttling) that restricts users to <strong>300</strong> requests per minute per access token.\nCertain resource intensive operations, such as attaching a file and getting cell history, count as 10 requests.\nSmartsheet reserves the right to enforce this limit depending on the load on our systems.</p>\n<p>If and when the limit is enforced, any requests that exceed this limit are rejected with an <strong>429</strong> HTTP status code, along with the following JSON response body:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"json language-json\">{\n  \"errorCode\": 4003,\n  \"message\": \"Rate limit exceeded.\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Smartsheet recommends that you design your integration to gracefully handle this rate limit error.\nOne way of doing that would be to have your integration <em>sleep</em> for 60 seconds when this error is encountered, and then subsequently retry the request.\nAlternatively, you might choose to implement <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">exponential backoff</a> (an error handling strategy whereby you periodically retry a failed request with progressively longer wait times between retries, until either the request succeeds or the certain number of retry attempts is reached).</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid Executing \"Rapid Fire\" Updates</strong></p>\n<p>If the only thing your integration does is execute an <a href=\"/tag/rows#operation/update-rows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Update Rows</a> request once every second for the same sheet, that would only amount to a total of 60 requests per minute -- well within rate limiting guidelines.\nHowever, updating the same object in such rapid succession could result in save errors that negatively impact both your integration as well as user experience within the Smartsheet app.\nTo avoid this scenario, design your integration such that API requests are never executed with rapid-fire succession against the same Smartsheet object.\nFor maximum efficiency, consider batching up changes and submitting them in a single request using a <a href=\"#section/Work-at-Scale/Bulk-Operations\">bulk operation</a> (for example, <a href=\"/tag/rows#operation/update-rows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Update Rows</a> or <a href=\"/tag/columns#operation/columns-addToSheet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Add Columns</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Execute Requests Serially</strong></p>\n<p>Executing multiple API requests in parallel to update a specific Smartsheet object results in reduced performance and often results in errors due to save collisions.\nTo avoid this scenario, design your integration such that API requests to update a specific Smartsheet object are always executed serially (that is, execute one request at time, not beginning the next request until the previous request has completed).</p>\n<p>NOTE: Attempts to perform multiple concurrent updates to a sheet may result in <a href=\"#section/Error-Code-List/400-Level-Error-Codes\">error code 4004</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"authentication\">Authentication</h1>\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> --></label>",
